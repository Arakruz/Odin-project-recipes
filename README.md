# About
This is a project done while completing the introductory course for web development from the 
[Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this project is to learn the basic skills in html and css
necessary to make a webpage. To achieve this the project is broken into two parts, the first focusing on the html side
and the second on css. The final webpage should be a simple recipes website, containing different pages, images, lists,
headers, titles and other basic html functions.
